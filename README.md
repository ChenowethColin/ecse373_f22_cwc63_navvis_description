# ecse373_f22_cwc63_navvis_description

Code is ran using `roslaunch naavis_description display.luanch &`

Params that can be added are `use_xacro:=true` (default is false) and `use_gui:=false` (default is tru)

Suggested use: `roslaunch naavis_description display.luanch use_xacro:=true &` because the .urdf file has doesn't have wheels
